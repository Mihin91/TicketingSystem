üîç Project Structure
  The project is divided into three main components:

  CLI
  Backend
  Frontend
    1. CLI
      Located in the CLI directory, this component allows users to configure and manage the ticketing simulation via the command line.

  Key Components:

  Configuration.java: Handles configuration parameters and JSON file operations.
  Customer.java: Represents customer participants in the simulation.
  Vendor.java: Represents vendor participants in the simulation.
  TicketPool.java: Manages the pool of tickets with thread-safe operations.
  Logger.java: Centralized logging utility.
  Participant.java: Abstract class for participants.
  TicketingSystem.java: Main class to run the simulation.

  2. Backend
    Located in the Backend directory, this is a Spring Boot application that manages the simulation logic, RESTful APIs, WebSockets, and database interactions.

  Key Components:
  
  Controllers: Handle API requests and WebSocket messages.
  ConfigurationController.java
  VendorController.java
  CustomerController.java
  LogController.java
  SystemController.java
  TicketController.java
  Services: Contain business logic and interact with repositories.
  ConfigurationService.java
  VendorService.java
  CustomerService.java
  TicketPoolService.java
  TicketService.java
  LogService.java
  Repositories: Interface with the H2 database.
  ConfigurationRepository.java
  VendorRepository.java
  CustomerRepository.java
  TicketRepository.java
  Models: Define the data structures.
  Configuration.java
  Vendor.java
  Customer.java
  Ticket.java
  Runnables: Handle concurrent operations.
  VendorRunnable.java
  CustomerRunnable.java
  Config: Configuration classes for CORS, WebSockets, and Security.
  CorsConfig.java
  WebSocketConfig.java
  SecurityConfig.java
  ModelMapperConfig.java
  Events: Custom events.
  TicketsSoldOutEvent.java
  
  3. Frontend
    Located in the Frontend directory, this is a React application that provides a user interface to interact with the simulation.

  Key Components:

  Components:
  
  ConfigurationForm.jsx: Form to create and save configurations.
  ConfigurationDisplay.jsx: Displays saved configurations.
  ControlPanel.jsx: Controls to start and stop the simulation.
  TicketStatus.jsx: Displays the current status of tickets.
  LogDisplay.jsx: Shows real-time logs.
  Navbar.jsx: Navigation bar.
  
  Pages:
  ConfigPage.jsx: Page for managing configurations.
  DashboardPage.jsx: Main dashboard for monitoring and control.
  
  Utilities:
  ApiClient.jsx: Handles API requests.
  Styling:
  index.css: Global styles.

Usage
  1. Running the Backend
    Ensure that the backend server is running by following the Setup Backend steps. The backend provides RESTful APIs and WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication.
  
  2. Running the Frontend
    Start the frontend React application as described in the Setup Frontend section. Access the dashboard and configuration pages to interact with the simulation.

  3. Using the CLI
    The CLI allows you to configure and manage the ticketing simulation.

  Load Configuration: Load existing configurations from a JSON file.
  Save Configuration: Save current settings to a JSON file for future use.
  Start Simulation: Initiate the simulation with the configured parameters.
  Stop Simulation: Gracefully terminate the simulation.
  Display Status: View the current status of tickets, vendors, and customers.

API Documentation
  The backend provides several RESTful APIs for managing configurations, vendors, customers, and logs.

  Configuration APIs
  Manage simulation configurations.

  Save Configuration

  Endpoint: POST /api/configurations/save
  Description: Saves a new configuration.
  Request Body: ConfigurationDTO
  Response: Saved ConfigurationDTO

  Get Latest Configuration

  Endpoint: GET /api/configurations/latest

  Response: Success message.


Integration
  WebSockets
    The backend uses WebSockets with STOMP protocol to provide real-time updates to the frontend.

  WebSocket Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/ws
  
  Topics Subscribed:
    /topic/tickets/status: Receives updates on ticket status.
    /topic/logs: Receives real-time log messages.
    
  Frontend Integration:
  
  Utilizes StompJS and SockJS to establish WebSocket connections.
  Subscribes to relevant topics to receive live data.
  
  Database
  An in-memory H2 database is used for development and testing purposes.

  Access H2 Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
  JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:Ticketsdb
  Username: sa
  Password: (leave blank)
  
  Entities:
